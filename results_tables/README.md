# Additional scripts

Some additional scripts to produce useful tables (not used in primary analyses):

* `2020-02-14_genotype-phenotype_Ace1.R`: run genotype-phenotype association tests for the two *Ace1* non-synonymous mutations (A65S and G280S) present in the `CIcol` population.

* `2020-02-14_heatmaps.R`: output various heatmaps: frequency of *Ace1* mutations per population, frequency of duplications per population, cross-tabulation of mutation and duplication frequencies, etc. Also runs genotype-phenotype association tests for the combinations of CNVs and mutations in the `CIcol` population.
