# Additional scripts

Some additional scripts. These are used to produce various panels in figs 1, 2 and 10 and tables 1 & 2; but they are not reqired for the primary analyses.

* `2020-02-17_heatmaps.R`: produce tables and heatmaps of the frequencies of *119S* alleles and *Ace1* duplications in each *Ag1000G* population. Also runs **genotype-phenotype association** tests for the combinations of CNVs and mutations in the `CIcol` population.

* `2020-02-17_genotype-phenotype_Biobank_119S.R`: Test genotype-phenotype associations for each population of the Biobank dataset. First, using G119S mutations (Pipini and Van 't Hof); second, using CNVs (Rippon).
