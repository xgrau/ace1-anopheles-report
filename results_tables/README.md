# CNV analyses and more

Run in this folder:

* `2020-02-17_heatmaps.R`: produce tables and heatmaps of the frequencies of *280S* alleles and *Ace1* duplications in each *Ag1000G* population. These are used to produce various panels in figs 1, 2, but they are not reqired for the primary analyses.

* `2020-09-19_CNV_haplotypescore.py`: plot haplotype score along the *Ace1* duplication, and other quality control statistics.

* `2020-03-09_CNV_coverage_Lucasetal2019.R`: plot 1) normalised sequencing coverage along the *Ace1* duplication for each *Ag1000G* sample, grouped by population and duplication presence status; and 2) sequencing coverage and haplotype scores at *Ace1* and the haplotype tagging loci.
