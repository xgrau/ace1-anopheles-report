# Genotype-phenotype analysis

* `2020-02-21_phe-gen_CIcol.R`: runs **genotype-phenotype association** tests for the combinations of CNVs and mutations in the `CIcol` population (Ag1000G dataset)

* `2020-03-05_phe-gen_WApops_280S.R`: runs **genotype-phenotype association** tests for G280S alleles and pirimiphos-methyl resistance, for each of the additional populations of West African *col* and *gam*.

* `2020-03-05_phe-gen_WApops_CNVs.R`: Same for CNVs.
